Task definitions and acceptance requirements belong here. Browser adapters, execution scheduling, generic scoring code and report rendering belong in the selected execution harness. Include a task ID and a reproducible accepted/rejected example when reporting a rule problem.

Use Python 3.11 or newer and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Run `uv sync --frozen`, then `make check`. Tests use synthetic inputs and need no browser, network access or historical source bundle. Keep the English and Chinese READMEs aligned; other guides use English.

A task revision must explain the intended requirement, preserve the prior input version, and include scenarios that should pass and fail. Update the original dataset, catalog, public task definitions, input manifest and registry together after independent source verification. Do not regenerate old hashes to disguise an input correction. Frozen quotes retain their original language.

Keep measured outputs, captures, credentials and internal review notes outside Git. A result proposal must supply the evidence listed in the [protocol](docs/protocol.md); opening a PR does not add it to a leaderboard. See [THIRD_PARTY](THIRD_PARTY.md) before sharing source material.
